# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions

This time I decided to solve each day in a different programming language.

To make the challenge easier, I used AWK to convert the data files into
inline data in the day's language (I tried to be fair and do only trivial transformations).
After `make`-ing the project, you can run a specific day by `./run.sh` followed by the day's number.

Here's a table of the languages.

| Day | Language   | Implementation       | Notes                                              |
|-----|------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Uiua       | 0.14.0-dev.5         | Sort (‚çÜ) was still experimental in 0.13.0          |
| 2   | Assembly   | NASM 2.16.03         | x86-64 Linux, uses only syscalls                   |
| 3   | Smalltalk  | GNU Smalltalk 3.2.92 | Reads the data by itself                           |
| 4   | BQN        | CBQN cf19280         |                                                    |
| 5   | Forth      | Gforth 0.7.9         | Uses only the core and core extension wordsets [1] |
| 6   | Haskell    | GHC 9.4.8            |                                                    |
| 7   | Erlang     | Erlang/OTP 27.1.2    |                                                    |
| 8   | PicoLisp   | PicoLisp 18.9.5      |                                                    |
| 9   | FORTRAN    | GNU Fortran 14.2.1   | Needs 8-byte integers (-fdefault-integer-8)        |
| 10  | Go         | Go 1.23.4            |                                                    |
| 11  | Prolog     | SWI-Prolog 9.2.7     | Originally planned to do it in Perl                |
| 12  | Perl       | Perl 5.40.0          | Command line argument indicates Part 1 or 2        |
| 13  | Zig        | Zig 0.13.0           | Literal array of structs created by AWK            |
| 14  | JavaScript | Node.js 23.1.0       | The `show` variable controls image display         |
