# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions

This time I decided to solve each day in a different programming language.

To make the challenge easier, I used AWK to convert the data files into
inline data in the day's language (I tried to be fair and only do trivial transformations).
After `make`-ing the project, you can run a specific day by `./run.sh` followed by the day's number.

Here's a table of the languages.

| Day | Language | Implementation | Notes                                     |
|-----|----------|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Uiua     | 0.14.0-dev.5   | Sort (‚çÜ) was still experimental in 0.13.0 |
